Data Structures Project 2 - GeoMarketing

## Project statement

SportsRUs has an app for smartphones and analyzes the data collected by it. The application registers the location where its users are and the visits made in the company's stores. At each visit, the users receive a promotional code which offers a discount if they buy something. The application records for each visit if the user has used the code and the amount of the discount.
Also, users are encouraged to invite friends to install the application, and if an invitation has been accepted by another user, register it.	

We want to realize a program (in C ++ without STL) using data structures (not database) to receive information, store them in memory in order to answer calls. For these functionalities, the program needs to define specific methods in class Service attached.

A number of other programs, test (checker) or report generation, which will not be developed by you, will use your program, calling(merge mai bine calling cred) in any order and at any time the methods specified in the Service class. You will be offered an example of checker shortly after the start of the project.

## Task 1
Company executives want these reports:
- How many visits were recorded between two timestamps specified as input
- How much discount was recorded between two timestamps specified as input
- What are the users with the best number of shoppings versus discount granted

## Task 2
Store managers want the following reports:
- How many visits did their store receive within a certain timeframe specified as input
- What are the top X discounts granted in their shop, where X is specified as input
- What are the top X greater distances from whom customers come to shop, where X is specified as input
- What are the busiest K days depending on the number of visits, where K is specified as input

## Task 3
Development director wants these reports:
- How many different groups of users have used the application and what are its sizes
- Who is the user who has brought the most users
- What is the longest chain of invitations
- Which are the groups of users with the most visits in total
- To each group, which is the average number of visits per user
- In what area should build a new store to serve more visitors

Note: SportsRUs are open to new ideas functionalities from you, just waiting to Board
impressed;)
